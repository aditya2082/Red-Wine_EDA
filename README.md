# Red-Wine_EDA

My analysis will use Red Wine Quality Data Set, available on the UCI machine learning repository https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btkhimsar/DataSets/master/winequality-red. I obtained the red wine samples from the north of Portugal to model red wine quality based on physicochemical tests. The dataset contains a total of 12 variables, which were recorded for 1,599 observations. This data will allow us to create different regression models to determine how different independent variables help predict our dependent variable, quality. Knowing how each variable will impact the red wine quality will help producers, distributors, and businesses in the red wine industry better assess their production, distribution, and pricing strategy.

## About Data Set

Input variables:

1. fixed acidity
2. volatile acidity
3. citric acid
4. residual sugar
5. chlorides
6. free sulfur dioxide
7. total sulfur dioxide
8. density
9. pH
10. sulphates
11. alcohol
Output variable:

12. quality (score between 0 and 10)

In this module, we'll be performing EDA on Red Wine data.
